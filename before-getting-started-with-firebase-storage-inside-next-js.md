# Before Getting Started with Firebase Storage Inside Next.js

## CORS

Be sure to update your bucketâ€™s CORS policies to allow connecting from your origin via the http request methods you are using.

First, install the gcloud SDK. Then run the following to login.

```
gcloud init
```

Then navigate to the directory where your preferred CORS JSON settings are stored. Then run the following and replace cors.json with the filename of your cors JSON.

```
gsutil cors set cors.json gs://<project>.appspot.com
```

## Bucket Permissions

In your Firebase console navigate to Storage -&gt; Rules. Use the following settings, replacing &lt;project slug&gt; with your project slug.

```javascript
service firebase.storage {
    match /b/<project>.appspot.com/o {
        match /{allPaths=**} {
            // Allow access by all users
            allow read, write;
        }
    }
}
```
